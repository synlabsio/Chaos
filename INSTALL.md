# Chaos installation process.

There are two methods to install Chaos: a seamless one-liner or for experienced developers, via repository clone.

## One-liner.

At Mudlet's command line, simply enter 
`lua downloadFile(getMudletHomeDir().."/chaos.lua", [[https://github.com/fgdfgfd/Chadfgdfg/blob/main/fdgfgh.lua]])`
and hit enter.

## For experienced developers, simply clone the repository to your chosen location and require `chaos.lua` either on an event or in a script somewhere.
